# Pathfinding Visualizer

Web application for visualizing Pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra, A\* Search, Depth-first Search and Breadthfirst Search)

A pathfinding algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two points (start point and end point). This application visualize various pathfinding algorithms in action.

## Features

- Adding walls
- Dragging start and end node
- Visualize algorithm
- Clear paths and walls
- Generate maze algorithm

## Get to know the algorithms

Not all algorithms are created equal.

- Dijkstra's Algorithm: the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path
- Breath-first Search: a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path
- Depth-first Search: a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path
- A\* Search: arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm
