# Pathfinding Visualizer

Web application for visualizing Pathfinding algorithms (Dijkstra, A* Search, Depth-first Search and Breadthfirst Search) 

A pathfinding algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two points (start point and end point). This application visualize various pathfinding algorithms in action.

## Get to know the algorithms

Not all algorithms are created equal.

- Dijkstra's Algorithm: the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path
- Breath-first Search: a great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path
- Depth-first Search: a very bad algorithm for pathfinding; does not guarantee the shortest path
- A* Search: arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Built With

- React.js, CSS & Bootstrap
